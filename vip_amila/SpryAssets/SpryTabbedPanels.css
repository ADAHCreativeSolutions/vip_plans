/* Horizontal Tabbed Panels
 *
 * The default style for a TabbedPanels widget places all tab buttons
 * (left aligned) above the content panel.
 */

/* This is the selector for the main TabbedPanels container. For our
 * default style, this container does not contribute anything visually,
 * but it is floated left to make sure that any floating or clearing done
 * with any of its child elements are contained completely within the
 * TabbedPanels container, to minimize any impact or undesireable
 * interaction with other floated elements on the page that may be used
 * for layout.
 *
 * If you want to constrain the width of the TabbedPanels widget, set a
 * width on the TabbedPanels container. By default, the TabbedPanels widget
 * expands horizontally to fill up available space.
 *
 * The name of the class ("TabbedPanels") used in this selector is not
 * necessary to make the widget function. You can use any class name you
 * want to style the TabbedPanels container.
